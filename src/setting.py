  #default browser
    #only one of the browsers can be chosen - if one button is clicked, switch to that
  #comparison browser
    #the option you choose as default becomes not an option here
    #at most two browsers can be chosen
    #error message when more than two are chosen
  #comparison language
  

  #when none is chosen, the message that says you need to choose something appears
  #once one option is chosen, the checkbox is checked

  #while loop - when the setting button is clicked again, the setting page disappears
